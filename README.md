This is a rust implementation for the Ray tracer challenge.
the ray tracer  challenge is a book for building a simple ray tracer in your prefered language.
The result is a library which can render a picture, currently in ppm format using ray tracing.
The book as far as I know only covers CPU based rendering so it is incredibly slow compared to GPU based.
I might upgrade it after I am done with the book to a GPU based renderer and render directly to a window instead of a picuter,
we will see.

For now I try to do one commit per chapter so if you want to see my code from a specific chapter then look at my commit history 
and work from there.
